EMAIL VERIFIER SYSTEM

This is a python code written to validate emails to reduce bounce rate in email campaigning or mass mailing!

Problem: When the team was running an email campaign, they noticed that some of the mail ids they got from the service provider had errors, which caused a high rate of emails that didn't work. This hurt our company's domain, and the $10K per month cost of email verification was too much for a new business.

Solution: I made a program with Python code to check emails. It takes a list of emails as input and gives a CSV file with True if the email is correct and false if it is not.

Value Addition: By using this system, companies can now verify emails and save about Rs. 2 lac per year.

Email Validation is a key part of email marketing best practices. That's because maintaining a healthy reputation and a good relationship with Internet Service Providers and Email Service Providers is challenging. Plus, it's tough to make it to the inbox and earn a high deliverability rate.

Even if your email lists are built correctly and organic, and they follow all the standards for email marketing, they still run the risk of falling victim to spam traps. And because spam traps, bounce rates, and complaint rates will determine your reputation as a sender, you can’t afford to ignore this fact.

A poor sender reputation means you won't make it to the inbox. That's money, time and customers lost.

Email verification is a service that identifies possible spam traps and other email address discrepancies before they’re flagged by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or Email Service Providers (ESPs) and cause permanent damage to your reputation.

Email Validation is a procedure that verifies if an email address is deliverable and valid. It runs a swift process that catches any syntax errors. It also confirms if a particular email address exists with a reliable domain such as Gmail or Outlook. This not only helps in organizing and cleaning your list of email addresses but also helps in protecting your email sender score, maximizing the efficiency of your email program.

Email Validation Process has mainly 4 phases or steps: 1- Syntax Validation 2- Domain Existence 3- MX record or mail server existence. 4- Mailbox or Email Verification.

Why is Email Verification Important? Most Websites have their optin forms that visitors need to fill in. During this fill-up process, users may, intentionally and evidently, enter wrong email addresses. By accepting them, your email list will be filled up with inaccurate and undeliverable email addresses.

If you send an email to such addresses, Your Bounce Rate will be higher, and this will negatively affect your mail server reputation. A poor reputation of your mail server IP address will result in blacklisting by popular email services.

By verifying email lists and checking to deliver reports, you improve a lot of options: ▪️ Open Rates ▪️ Bounce Rates ▪️ Click-through Rates ▪️ Conversion Rates
